## Problem Statement

Codex currently does not wake the calling agent when background subprocesses or subagents complete (`openai/codex#15723`). That blocks the task-153 direction of making completion notifications preempt unrelated side discussion: if no new Codex turn is scheduled when a worker finishes, Spacedock cannot rely on a notification to make the first officer take autonomous follow-up action.

Spacedock still has a separate, local problem it can solve now. In interactive Codex sessions, task 138 established that workers should stay in the background by default unless the next orchestration step is blocked on their result. Task 140 established that completed gated or critical-path work becomes the next required action. Task 131 established that critical-path reused workers must be awaited on the same handle after `send_input`. The missing piece is what happens when the first officer intentionally decides that the next step is blocked and starts waiting, then the captain interrupts before the worker result is collected.

Today that wait intent is only implicit in the ongoing `wait_agent` call or in surrounding prose. If the captain interrupts the session with a question or instruction, the FO can lose the fact that it was still blocked on a specific set of worker results. The result is either drift back into ordinary conversation or an accidental reliance on unsupported completion wakeups. The desired end state is an explicit, preemptible `wait_agent` mode: the FO records the live wait set, tells the captain what it is waiting on and that interruption is safe, treats non-stopping captain input as `preempted_by_user_input`, handles the input, and then resumes `wait_agent` for the same FO-uncollected wait set unless the captain explicitly pauses/stops or the interruption creates a clarification blocker.

Completion notifications remain useful as opportunistic evidence when Codex surfaces them, but they are not the authority for this task. Under the current upstream limitation, resumed `wait_agent` collection on the live handle is the authoritative path.

## Scope Boundary

In scope:

- Codex first-officer runtime guidance for an explicit preemptible wait mode when the entity's next orchestration step is blocked on worker results.
- The live wait-intent fields the FO must preserve for every wait-set entry: worker label, logical worker id, runtime handle, entity/stage, blocked reason, and whether the result is still FO-uncollected.
- Operator-facing wait status wording that names every FO-owned worker label in the wait set, names the blocked reason, and uses the precise safe-interruption/resume hint. Ordinary wait-status prose should not expose raw handle UUIDs; runtime handles belong in internal wait intent, logs, and tests.
- Outcome labels for wait attempts: `completed`, `timed_out`, `failed`, `preempted_by_user_input`, `paused_by_user`, and `clarification_required`.
- Static checks, parser helpers, and transcript fixtures that prove interrupted waits preserve every wait-set entry and resume `wait_agent` on the same FO-uncollected handles without requiring Codex to wake the FO on completion.

Out of scope:

- Solving `openai/codex#15723` or depending on completion notifications to schedule a new turn.
- Reopening task 153's completion-notification preemption path while that upstream wakeup limitation remains open.
- Reversing task 138 by foregrounding every dispatched worker in interactive mode. Preemptible waiting applies only after the FO determines the next step is blocked on worker output or the captain explicitly asks it to wait.
- Changing shared first-officer scheduling semantics unless a tiny cross-reference is required. The behavioral contract is Codex-specific.
- Adding polling sleeps, background watcher scripts, or prompt-level behavioral coaching in the Codex invocation helper as the proof mechanism.

## Proposed Approach

1. Define `wait_agent` as an explicit Codex FO mode.

   Add a Codex runtime section in `skills/first-officer/references/codex-first-officer-runtime.md` that distinguishes three states:

   - background worker: spawned and tracked, but the current interactive turn is not blocked on it
   - preemptible wait: the FO is blocked on one or more FO-uncollected wait-set entries and is intentionally calling `wait_agent`
   - post-wait completion handling: `wait_agent` returned completion evidence and task-140/task-131 rules decide the next workflow action

   The contract should say that entering preemptible wait requires a recorded wait intent before the `wait_agent` call. That intent is a wait set, not a scalar handle. For each entry it includes the FO-owned worker label, `dispatch_agent_id`, runtime handle, entity path/id, stage name, blocked reason, and whether the wait came from a fresh dispatch or same-handle reuse after `send_input`.

   `Unresolved` means FO-uncollected, not necessarily still running. If a worker completes while the FO is answering an interruption, that wait-set entry remains unresolved until the FO resumes `wait_agent` on the same handle and collects/reconciles the completion evidence. Completion notifications during the interruption are opportunistic evidence only; they do not replace the resumed collection path.

2. Make operator-facing wait status concrete.

   Before waiting, the FO should emit a concise status line shaped like:

   ```text
   Waiting on `048-implementation/Ensign feedback cycle 2` and `054-implementation/Ensign` before I can advance the blocked workflow state. You can send a message and hit Esc to interrupt safely; I’ll process the additional feedback and resume waiting for ensigns unless you tell me to pause or stop.
   ```

   The exact leading clause can vary with the blocked reason and labels, but the safety hint should use this precise shape: `You can send a message and hit Esc to interrupt safely; I’ll process the additional feedback and resume waiting for ensigns unless you tell me to pause or stop.` Avoid weaker wording that permits interruption without the safety and resume guarantee.

   User-facing wait status should name every worker label in the wait set. It should not print raw handle UUIDs in ordinary prose. Handles remain required in internal wait intent, logs, and tests so same-handle collection can be verified.

3. Define interruption and resume semantics.

   If captain input arrives while any wait-set entry is FO-uncollected, the FO treats the current wait attempt as `preempted_by_user_input`, not as `completed`, `failed`, or `timed_out`. It then handles the input according to ordinary FO rules:

   - If the captain says pause, stop, cancel, or changes the requested workflow target, the wait intent becomes `paused_by_user` or is superseded explicitly.
   - If the captain asks a question that can be answered without changing the blocked workflow, the FO answers and resumes `wait_agent` for every still-FO-uncollected entry in the prior wait set.
   - If the captain's input dispatches additional worker work that becomes part of the same blocked next step, the FO updates the wait set, reports the new worker labels in user-facing prose, and records the new handles internally before waiting again.
   - If the interruption reveals missing information required before waiting can continue, the mode becomes `clarification_required` and the FO must not pretend it is still waiting.

   This keeps user interruption support local and explicit without asking Codex to deliver unsupported autonomous wakeups.

4. Add focused tests and fixtures around the contract.

   Static runtime-content checks should live in `tests/test_agent_content.py` and assert that the Codex FO runtime names the preemptible wait mode, wait-intent fields, interruption outcome labels, same-handle resume rule, and unsupported-notification boundary.

   Parser or transcript tests should use `scripts/test_lib.py` / `CodexLogParser` or a small sibling helper if that keeps the assertions clean. The useful fixture shape is a synthetic Codex JSONL/transcript sequence with:

   - an initial `wait_agent`/`wait` call for handles `item_23` and `item_42`
   - a user interruption before the FO has collected/reconciled completion for every wait-set entry
   - an FO response that marks or narrates `preempted_by_user_input`
   - a resumed `wait_agent`/`wait` call with the same `receiver_thread_ids` values for every FO-uncollected wait-set entry
   - eventual completion evidence for those same handles, including the case where one worker completed during the interruption but still had to be collected/reconciled by the resumed wait

   Existing live surfaces to verify or extend include `tests/test_codex_packaged_agent_e2e.py` for same-handle reuse expectations and `tests/test_test_lib_helpers.py` for parser-level fixtures. A new narrow fixture file is acceptable if the existing helpers do not naturally represent user interruption events.

5. Keep live E2E claims proportional.

   A true interactive Codex PTY test would be valuable if the harness can deterministically inject user input while a `wait_agent` call is pending. That should be treated as medium/high cost and optional for the first implementation slice unless the runtime already exposes a stable boundary. The required proof for this task can be a transcript fixture because the task is intentionally avoiding unsupported completion-wakeup behavior.

## Acceptance criteria

**AC-1 - The Codex first-officer runtime defines preemptible wait as a distinct mode from background workers and post-completion handling.**

Tested by static content checks in `tests/test_agent_content.py` against `skills/first-officer/references/codex-first-officer-runtime.md`, asserting the three states are present and that preemptible wait applies only when the next orchestration step is blocked or the captain explicitly asks to wait.

**AC-2 - The Codex wait-intent contract preserves enough identity to resume every FO-uncollected worker in the wait set.**

Tested by static checks and a transcript/parser fixture asserting every wait-set entry includes worker label, logical id, runtime handle, entity/stage, blocked reason, and FO-collected/uncollected state, and that resumed waits reuse the same `receiver_thread_ids` values after interruption.

**AC-3 - User-facing wait status names every FO-owned worker label, gives the blocked reason, and uses the precise safe-interruption hint without raw handles.**

Tested by static wording checks or transcript fixture assertions that the wait status prominently includes every FO-owned worker label in the wait set, says why the FO is blocked, includes the sentence shape `You can send a message and hit Esc to interrupt safely; I’ll process the additional feedback and resume waiting for ensigns unless you tell me to pause or stop.`, and does not expose raw handle UUIDs in ordinary user-facing prose.

**AC-4 - Non-stopping captain input during a pending wait is represented as `preempted_by_user_input` and resumes waiting on the same FO-uncollected wait set.**

Tested by a focused transcript or parser test where the initial wait on handles `H1` and `H2`, a user interruption, the FO answer, and the resumed wait on the still-FO-uncollected handles appear in order before completion evidence is reconciled. The test must fail if the resumed wait uses replacement handles, treats the interruption as completion/failure, drops any FO-uncollected wait-set entry, or skips resumed collection because a completion notification appeared during the interruption.

**AC-5 - Wait outcomes distinguish preemption from completion, timeout, failure, user pause/stop, and clarification blockers.**

Tested by static contract checks plus parser/fixture assertions for outcome labels: `completed`, `timed_out`, `failed`, `preempted_by_user_input`, `paused_by_user`, and `clarification_required`.

**AC-6 - The finished behavior does not depend on unsupported Codex completion wakeups.**

Tested by static checks that completion notifications are described as opportunistic evidence only, plus review of the focused fixture/test to confirm the authoritative collection path is resumed `wait_agent` on live handles, not a simulated autonomous completion notification that schedules a new FO turn or replaces FO reconciliation.

## Test Plan

Static contract tests are low cost and should be required:

- `uv run --with pytest python tests/test_agent_content.py -q`
- Assertions for preemptible wait mode, plural wait-intent fields, wait-status content, outcome labels, same-handle wait-set resume wording, raw-handle suppression in ordinary prose, and the explicit boundary around `openai/codex#15723`.

Parser and transcript fixture tests are low/medium cost and should be the primary behavioral proof:

- Add or extend a focused parser test, likely in `tests/test_test_lib_helpers.py`, using synthetic Codex JSONL/transcript events that show wait set `{H1, H2}`, user interruption, `preempted_by_user_input`, resumed wait on every still-FO-uncollected entry in `{H1, H2}`, and eventual reconciliation of completion evidence.
- If needed, add a small helper in `scripts/test_lib.py` or `CodexLogParser` to extract wait/preemption/resume sequences by handle without scattering ad hoc JSON traversal across tests.
- The fixture must include the case where one worker completes during the interruption but remains FO-uncollected until the resumed wait. It must not model completion notifications as the thing that wakes the FO; the proof is the preserved wait intent and explicit resumed `wait_agent`.

Live Codex E2E is optional for the first implementation slice and should only be claimed if the harness can deterministically inject input during a pending `wait_agent` call:

- Candidate surface: a new narrow Codex interactive/PTY harness test if `scripts/test_lib_interactive.py` or a sibling helper can expose an input-ready boundary during wait.
- Expected cost: medium/high, because task 153 already showed the completion-notification surface is upstream-blocked and current Codex interactive observability is fragile.
- If no stable live boundary exists, the implementation should state that the live E2E is deferred and rely on static plus transcript coverage rather than overclaiming.

Regression checks for related same-handle behavior should remain in scope when touched:

- `uv run --with pytest python tests/test_codex_packaged_agent_e2e.py -q` when live Codex credentials/runtime budget are available, because it already checks `send_input` followed by `wait` on the same worker handle.
- `uv run --with pytest python tests/test_rejection_flow.py --runtime codex` only if implementation changes feedback/reuse routing behavior. This task should not otherwise broaden into task 153 or shared rejection-flow scheduling.

E2E need: not mandatory for acceptance unless implementation claims real interactive interruption handling beyond the transcript fixture. The minimum acceptable proof is static contract coverage plus a deterministic fixture showing interruption-resume on the same FO-uncollected wait set without unsupported wakeups.

- Upstream Codex issue: https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/15723
- Related but not equivalent local task: `153` (`codex-completion-notifications-must-preempt-side-discussion`) depends on completion notification wakeup behavior that is currently upstream-blocked.
- Related local context: task `138` owns background-by-default interactive waits, task `140` owns completed gated/critical-path work becoming the next required action, task `131` owns same-handle waiting after critical-path reuse, and tasks `132`/`137` cover Codex visibility and FO-owned worker labels.

## Stage Report: ideation

- DONE: The design clearly distinguishes preemptible explicit waiting from upstream-blocked completion-notification preemption.
  Evidence: `## Problem Statement`, `## Scope Boundary`, and AC-6 separate `wait_agent` resume behavior from task 153 and `openai/codex#15723`.
- DONE: The proposed approach names concrete Codex runtime contract and test/fixture surfaces an implementation worker can edit or verify.
  Evidence: `## Proposed Approach` and `## Test Plan` name `codex-first-officer-runtime.md`, `tests/test_agent_content.py`, `scripts/test_lib.py`, `CodexLogParser`, `tests/test_test_lib_helpers.py`, and relevant live Codex tests.
- DONE: Acceptance criteria and test plan prove interruption-resume behavior on the same FO-uncollected wait set without requiring unsupported Codex wakeups.
  Evidence: AC-2, AC-4, AC-6, and the parser/transcript fixture plan require wait set `{H1, H2}`, interruption, resumed wait for FO-uncollected entries, and eventual reconciliation without notification-driven wakeup.

### Summary

Fleshed out the entity into a Codex-specific preemptible wait design. The plan keeps task 153's notification-preemption path out of scope, makes `wait_agent` on live handles authoritative, and defines static plus fixture coverage for user interruption followed by same-wait-set resume and reconciliation.

## Stage Report: ideation (cycle 2)

- DONE: Make the wait-mode hint explicit that interruption is safe.
  Evidence: `## Proposed Approach` now requires the concise Esc-based safety/resume sentence and rejects weaker interruption-only wording.
- DONE: Multi-handle wait-set coverage is implied but not strongly tested.
  Evidence: `## Scope Boundary`, AC-2, AC-4, and the parser/transcript fixture plan now require every label and internal handle in a plural wait set to be preserved and resumed.
- DONE: Define `unresolved` as FO-uncollected, not necessarily still running.
  Evidence: `## Proposed Approach` defines unresolved as FO-uncollected and requires resumed `wait_agent` collection even when a worker completes during the interruption.
- DONE: Clarify that raw handle UUIDs should not appear in ordinary wait-status prose.
  Evidence: `## Scope Boundary`, the wait-status example, and AC-3 keep handles in internal wait intent/logs/tests while user-facing status names worker labels.

### Summary

Revised the ideation spec for the captain and staff review feedback. The wait hint is now precise and concise, ordinary prose avoids raw handles, and the testable behavior is plural wait-set preservation with FO-uncollected completion reconciliation.
