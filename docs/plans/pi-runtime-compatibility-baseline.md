## Problem Statement

GitHub issue #147 asks whether Spacedock can support the Pi agent runtime and, if not yet, what minimum runtime support would be needed to make that credible. Today the repo has explicit Claude Code and Codex runtime adapters, runtime-specific tests, and harness branches, but no Pi runtime path.

The main product question is not "can Pi do everything Claude/Codex do right now?" but "what is the smallest first-class Pi runtime surface that proves Spacedock can orchestrate a real workflow under Pi?" The first proving bar should be a shared live-workflow baseline rather than full parity. That means scoping the work to the minimum runtime contract needed to dispatch an ensign, wait for completion, handle a gate correctly, and preserve Spacedock's worktree and reuse semantics where they matter.

A second design constraint is that Pi should be treated as a genuine runtime target, not a disguised Claude or Codex code path. The implementation can still use Pi-specific harness glue, but the workflow behavior should match the shared first-officer contract closely enough that existing runtime tests can grow a `--runtime pi` branch instead of inventing a separate Pi-only workflow model.

## Scope Boundary

In scope for the first Pi slice:

- Add Pi as a first-class runtime alongside Claude Code and Codex.
- Support both interactive and non-interactive/batch execution.
- Support worktree-backed stages from day 1.
- Support fresh worker dispatch, blocking wait, same-worker routed follow-up/reuse, and explicit shutdown.
- Allow Pi-specific harness glue where necessary, as long as workflow behavior matches the shared contract.
- Use `tests/test_gate_guardrail.py --runtime pi` as the first proving target.

Explicitly out of scope for the first slice:

- Standing teammates such as `comm-officer`.
- Startup/shutdown team lifecycle.
- Broad live-suite parity across all existing runtime tests.
- Large runtime-abstraction refactors across Claude/Codex/Pi.

## Proposed Approach

Use a thin first-class Pi runtime adapter over the existing FO/ensign contract rather than a broad runtime-generalization refactor or a throwaway Pi-only special mode.

The runtime should expose a Spacedock-owned worker-handle model even if Pi itself is implemented in terms of sessions. The smallest viable contract is:

1. **Fresh dispatch**
   - The FO can launch a Pi worker for a self-contained assignment.
   - The worker runs either at repo root or in an assigned worktree.
   - Dispatch returns a stable handle.

2. **Wait for completion**
   - The FO can wait on a specific worker handle until the worker is idle/completed.
   - Completion evidence comes from the worker's final response and the entity file/stage report.

3. **Reuse / routed follow-up**
   - The FO can send a concrete next-stage or feedback assignment to the same worker handle.
   - The worker becomes active again on that same handle.
   - The FO can wait for the new completion and must not treat a stale prior completion as evidence.

4. **Explicit shutdown**
   - The FO can mark a worker unroutable once no further advancement, feedback, or gate handling is expected.

5. **Session continuity**
   - Interactive and batch runs both preserve enough identity to reopen a worker handle for reuse.
   - The runtime handle may be a Pi session id plus local metadata.

6. **Worktree isolation**
   - The FO remains anchored at repo root.
   - Worktree-backed worker stages run with the worktree as their cwd.

The likely Pi mapping is one Pi session per worker. Fresh dispatch creates or opens a worker session and sends a fully self-contained assignment. Wait drives that session until idle/completion. Reuse reopens the same session and sends the follow-up assignment. Shutdown is recorded explicitly in Spacedock-owned metadata even if the underlying Pi session file still exists.

Architecturally, this suggests:

- add `skills/first-officer/references/pi-first-officer-runtime.md`
- add the corresponding Pi runtime branch in ensign runtime selection
- introduce a small Pi worker adapter/registry layer that stores worker label, session id, cwd/worktree path, entity/stage, and active/completed/shutdown state
- add a `--runtime pi` branch in the live harness so tests can launch Pi and parse Pi-specific evidence while preserving shared behavioral assertions

The first live behavior target is the gate-preflight sequence:

1. FO discovers workflow and dispatchable entity.
2. FO transitions the entity into the next stage.
3. FO creates a worktree when the stage requires it.
4. FO launches a Pi worker with a fully self-contained assignment.
5. FO waits for completion.
6. FO reads the produced stage report.
7. FO holds at the gate without self-approving.
8. FO reports the gate state clearly.

This is the smallest meaningful contract because it proves the FO can orchestrate a real worker cycle under Pi rather than merely parse files.

## Acceptance criteria

**AC-1 — Pi is defined as a first-class runtime surface rather than an undocumented variant of Claude or Codex.**
Verified by: static contract tests that assert Pi-specific runtime selection and a Pi runtime reference document exist for the FO/ensign path.

**AC-2 — Pi can drive the shared gate-preflight workflow shape in both interactive and batch contexts.**
Verified by: `unset CLAUDECODE && uv run pytest tests/test_gate_guardrail.py --runtime pi -v`.

**AC-3 — Pi worker orchestration supports fresh dispatch, same-worker routed follow-up/reuse, and explicit shutdown with stable worker identity.**
Verified by: focused Pi runtime unit/integration tests covering dispatch, wait, reuse, stale-completion rejection, and shutdown behavior.

**AC-4 — Worktree-backed stages run correctly under Pi while the FO remains anchored at repo root.**
Verified by: targeted Pi runtime tests asserting worktree cwd, worktree entity path routing, and repo-root FO operations.

**AC-5 — Pi-specific harness glue remains behaviorally compatible with the shared runtime test model.**
Verified by: harness/runtime tests that accept `--runtime pi` and preserve gate-guardrail behavioral assertions without creating a separate Pi-only workflow contract.

## Test Plan

Primary proof:

- `unset CLAUDECODE && uv run pytest tests/test_gate_guardrail.py --runtime pi -v`

Expected supporting tests:

- static contract assertions in `tests/test_agent_content.py` or equivalent for Pi runtime selection and contract wording
- focused Pi runtime tests for worker registry/identity, dispatch, wait, reuse, shutdown, and worktree cwd/entity-path behavior
- harness tests for `--runtime pi` command selection and parseable output capture

Suggested validation order:

1. add static/runtime-selection assertions first
2. add Pi worker-registry and adapter unit tests
3. add worktree-aware Pi runtime tests
4. add `--runtime pi` harness coverage
5. turn on the Pi branch in `tests/test_gate_guardrail.py`

Estimated complexity is medium. The first slice is intentionally smaller than full runtime parity, but it still crosses runtime contract selection, worker/session orchestration, test harness plumbing, and at least one real live workflow path.

## Implementation Notes

The design should prefer a thin adapter over a broad runtime abstraction rewrite. A runtime-generalization refactor is attractive long-term, but it is not the fastest or safest way to answer #147.

The riskiest technical edges are:

- Pi is session-oriented, so Spacedock must supply its own worker registry/handle semantics.
- Reuse must track a new completion epoch/turn boundary so a reopened session does not accidentally reuse stale completion evidence.
- Shutdown may need to be defined at the Spacedock metadata layer even if Pi does not expose a native per-worker kill primitive identical to other runtimes.
- Interactive and batch invocation can use different transport surfaces, but they should share one runtime contract and one worker metadata model.

A reasonable implementation order is:

- add Pi runtime contract files and runtime selection
- add the Pi worker/session registry
- implement dispatch/wait/reuse/shutdown semantics
- wire worktree-aware prompt/context assembly
- add `--runtime pi` harness support
- make the gate-preflight test pass
- add a narrower follow-up reuse test before broadening runtime parity

## Stage Report: ideation

- DONE: The task now names a bounded first-slice goal for Pi support instead of asking for undefined full parity.
  Evidence: `## Scope Boundary` defines first-class Pi support, worktrees, dispatch/wait/reuse/shutdown, and `tests/test_gate_guardrail.py --runtime pi` as the first proving target.
- DONE: The proposed approach selects a thin first-class Pi adapter over a larger runtime rewrite or a throwaway Pi-only mode.
  Evidence: `## Proposed Approach` defines the worker-handle/session model, runtime files, registry layer, harness branch, and first live behavior target.
- DONE: Acceptance criteria and test plan express end-state properties with reproducible checks.
  Evidence: `## Acceptance criteria` pairs each end-state property with concrete verification, and `## Test Plan` separates static, unit/integration, harness, and live gate-preflight coverage.

### Summary

This ideation pass reframes #147 as a minimum-runtime baseline problem rather than a full-parity runtime port. The recommended first slice is a first-class Pi runtime adapter that supports worktrees, fresh dispatch, wait, same-worker reuse, and explicit shutdown, with `tests/test_gate_guardrail.py --runtime pi` as the first meaningful proof.
