# Port test_rejection_flow (claude branch) to Cycle-7 Pattern Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Un-skip `tests/test_rejection_flow.py` at opus-4-7 teams mode by (a) splitting the 297-line dual-runtime file into `test_rejection_flow_claude.py` (teams-mode, cycle-7-patterned) and `test_rejection_flow_codex.py` (unchanged codex branch — NOT cycle-7-ported), and (b) rewriting the claude branch to assert the #141 reviewer-keepalive contract using streaming watcher + inbox-poll keep-alive. Codex branch remains on its current structure and assertions (out of cycle-7 scope; that harness is a separate adapter).

**Architecture:** Split by runtime into two files. Claude file pins `@pytest.mark.teams_mode`, uses the cycle-7 pattern, and replaces the `ensign_count >= 3` post-hoc branch with strict per-stage assertions that correctly model the #141 reuse: `impl dispatch close → validation dispatch close → SendMessage routes findings back to implementation → impl re-dispatch close (new Agent because the completed impl was shut down after validation) → validation RE-dispatch close (via SendMessage to the kept-alive validation reviewer — the #141 contract)`. Codex file stays untouched.

**Tech Stack:** Python, pytest, `scripts/test_lib.py` (`run_first_officer_streaming`, `FOStreamWatcher`, `DispatchBudget`, `expect_dispatch_close`, `expect`), `scripts/fo_inbox_poll.py`, `tests/fixtures/rejection-flow/`.

---

## Background

`tests/test_rejection_flow.py` has three coupled problems:

1. **Dual-runtime structure** — claude and codex paths share a single test function via a `runtime` parameter. The codex branch is ~130 lines of milestone/log parsing specific to the codex adapter; the claude branch is ~40 lines using `LogParser` + `run_first_officer`. The Tier-A table in `tests/README.md` explicitly recommends splitting: *"Split claude and codex into two tests if the shared invariant doesn't fit both."* The shared invariant doesn't fit both: claude teams use `SendMessage` reuse; codex uses `send_input` on a kept-alive worker pane. The runtimes route feedback differently.

2. **`#141` — reviewer keepalive across feedback cycles.** The test's current claude-branch post-hoc is `ensign_count >= 3` (expects three Agent dispatches: impl, validation, impl-fix). But per shared-core, **after validation REJECTs and the FO routes feedback back to implementation, the RE-review should reuse the same validation reviewer via SendMessage, not a fresh Agent.** So the correct dispatch count is 3 Agents (impl, validation, impl-fix) plus 1 SendMessage to the validation reviewer to kick off re-review. The `>=3` assertion doesn't distinguish "3 Agents + SendMessage reuse" (correct) from "4 Agents" (violates #141).

3. **Gated validation under `-p`.** The `rejection-flow` fixture has `gate: true` on `backlog` (initial) AND `validation`. Under `claude -p` there's no captain to approve, so the FO correctly holds and the test hangs. Same class as the cycle-7 `reuse-pipeline` issue we solved by dropping the gate (test_gate_guardrail.py owns the gate contract).

Currently `@pytest.mark.skip` (not xfail) on both runtimes. Un-skipping requires addressing all three.

## Fixture shape

`tests/fixtures/rejection-flow/README.md`:

```yaml
stages:
  defaults:
    worktree: false
    concurrency: 2
  states:
    - name: backlog
      initial: true
      gate: true          # drop this
    - name: implementation
      worktree: true
    - name: validation
      worktree: true
      fresh: true
      feedback-to: implementation
      gate: true          # drop this
    - name: done
      terminal: true
```

**Decision: drop `gate: true` on both backlog and validation.** Matches the cycle-7 `reuse-pipeline` decision. Gate behavior is covered by `test_gate_guardrail.py` with its own fixture. The rejection flow contract is about feedback routing after REJECT, not gate handling.

## Expected FO trajectory (claude teams mode, opus-4-7, post-fix)

1. `TeamCreate(...)`
2. `Agent(..., description="... implementation")` — cycle-1 impl
3. (ensign writes buggy `math_ops.py` per fixture → commits → Done)
4. FO polls inbox → observes Done → advances to validation
5. `Agent(..., description="... validation")` — cycle-1 validation (fresh: true per stage spec)
6. (validation ensign runs tests against `math_ops.py` → finds the `a - b` bug → writes REJECTED Stage Report → Done)
7. FO polls inbox → observes Done with REJECTED verdict
8. FO enters **Feedback Rejection Flow** (shared-core line 131): reads validation's `feedback-to: implementation`, tracks cycle 1 in entity's `### Feedback Cycles` section.
9. Per shared-core, FO checks `claude-team context-budget --name {impl-ensign}`. If reuse_ok, routes findings back via `SendMessage` to the kept-alive impl ensign; else fresh-dispatches.
10. **Case A (reuse):** `SendMessage(to="spacedock-ensign-buggy-add-task-implementation", ...)` with the fix request. Impl ensign fixes `math_ops.py` → second Done.
11. **Case B (fresh):** `Agent(..., description="... implementation-fix")` — cycle-2 impl. Emits Done.
12. Either way, FO now re-runs validation. **Per #141**, since the validation reviewer was kept alive at the gate (shared-core: "keep the worker alive while waiting at the gate"), the FO reuses via `SendMessage(to="spacedock-ensign-...validation", "Re-validate: ...")`. Validation emits second Done with PASSED.
13. FO advances `validation → done`, archives entity.
14. Sentinel touched, FO exits.

## Contract assertions (claude-branch test)

1. `TeamCreate` emitted.
2. `expect_dispatch_close(ensign_name="implementation", ...)` — cycle-1 impl.
3. `expect_dispatch_close(ensign_name="validation", ...)` — cycle-1 validation.
4. `expect(REJECTED in validation Stage Report via entity file OR fo-log text)` — rejection observed.
5. **Feedback routing.** Accept either (a) `expect(SendMessage to impl ensign)` for reuse path, or (b) `expect_dispatch_close(ensign_name="implementation", ...)` for fresh cycle-2 — whichever lands first. Record which path fired.
6. **Re-validation — the #141 contract.** `expect(SendMessage to validation ensign)` for reviewer reuse. Cycle-7 pattern: the reviewer reuse is just another SendMessage event in the stream.
7. Sentinel touched; try/except `expect_exit`.
8. Post-hoc: entity status=done OR archived.
9. Post-hoc: `len(dispatch_records)` ∈ {3, 4} — either "impl + validation + impl-fix" (reuse via SendMessage) or "impl + validation + impl-fix + validation-recheck" (fresh dispatch both cycles). The #141-aligned shape is 3 Agent dispatches plus 2 SendMessages (one for feedback routing, one for re-validation).

**Note on the #141 strictness.** We do NOT want to assert `len(records) == 3` strictly because (a) we can't guarantee the FO picks reuse over fresh-dispatch every time (opus variance), and (b) the `context-budget` check is a legitimate branch. The stricter assertion is "`SendMessage` to the validation ensign was emitted at some point" — which is the reuse signal the test #141 was designed to preserve.

## File Structure

- Create: `tests/test_rejection_flow_claude.py` (~210 lines, cycle-7 patterned)
- Modify: `tests/fixtures/rejection-flow/README.md` (drop two `gate: true` lines)
- Modify: `tests/test_rejection_flow.py` — rename/move to `tests/test_rejection_flow_codex.py`, strip claude branch, keep codex branch + codex-specific helpers (~175 lines, unchanged semantics)
- Delete: `tests/test_rejection_flow.py` (superseded by the two new files)

## Task breakdown

### Task 1: Un-gate the fixture

**Files:**
- Modify: `tests/fixtures/rejection-flow/README.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Verify no other test uses this fixture's gate behavior**

Run: `grep -rn "rejection-flow\|rejection-pipeline" tests/ | grep -v rejection_flow`
Expected: empty (only `test_rejection_flow.py` uses this fixture).

- [ ] **Step 2: Edit the fixture README**

In `tests/fixtures/rejection-flow/README.md`, delete the `      gate: true` line under both `backlog` and `validation` stages. Keep `fresh: true` and `feedback-to: implementation` on validation.

- [ ] **Step 3: Static check**

Run: `make test-static` → 475 passed.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/fixtures/rejection-flow/README.md
git commit -m "fixture: #210 drop gates on rejection-flow backlog + validation

Rejection flow contract is about feedback routing after REJECTED, not
gate handling. Under claude -p there's no captain to approve, so the
test hangs. Drop the gates; test_gate_guardrail.py owns the gate
contract with a dedicated fixture."
```

---

### Task 2: Split codex branch into its own test file

**Files:**
- Create: `tests/test_rejection_flow_codex.py`
- Modify: (will eventually delete) `tests/test_rejection_flow.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Copy the codex branch verbatim into the new file**

Create `tests/test_rejection_flow_codex.py` containing:
- The `_codex_rejection_flow_milestones`, `_codex_rejection_follow_up_order`, `_codex_rejection_flow_stop_ready` helper functions unchanged.
- A single `@pytest.mark.live_codex`-only test function that runs only the codex branch of the original body (lines 190-296 in the original). Drop the `runtime` parameter; hard-code codex.
- Remove `@pytest.mark.live_claude` marker and all claude-branch conditionals.
- Keep the `@pytest.mark.skip(reason="pending #141 ...")` for now — un-skipping codex is a separate concern (codex has its own `send_input` reuse semantics; this plan does not touch them).

- [ ] **Step 2: Static check**

Run: `make test-static` → 475 passed (new codex-only file should collect but is skipped).

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/test_rejection_flow_codex.py
git commit -m "split: #210 extract codex branch of test_rejection_flow into dedicated file

Mechanical split of the dual-runtime test into a codex-only sibling.
Codex branch body + helpers preserved verbatim; @pytest.mark.live_codex
only; runtime param removed. Skip marker retained for now — un-skipping
codex is out of scope for #210 (separate reuse semantics via send_input).

Next commit will replace tests/test_rejection_flow.py with the cycle-7
patterned claude-only test."
```

---

### Task 3: Rewrite claude branch as cycle-7 patterned test

**Files:**
- Modify: `tests/test_rejection_flow.py` — full rewrite as claude-teams-only cycle-7 test (rename the file? no: keep the original name so historical references still resolve; the codex branch was already split to a sibling file in Task 2)

- [ ] **Step 1: Overwrite `tests/test_rejection_flow.py`**

Replace the entire file content with the following cycle-7 patterned test (filename stays `test_rejection_flow.py`; after Task 2 it no longer conflicts with the codex sibling):

```python
# ABOUTME: E2E test for the validation rejection flow in the first-officer template.
# ABOUTME: Pinned to teams_mode; asserts impl + validation dispatches + SendMessage feedback routing + reviewer-reuse for re-validation (#141).

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify the `rejection_signal_present` helper still satisfies its old signature**

`rejection_signal_present` takes `(workflow_name, slug, entity_main, worktrees_dir, worker_messages, fo_text)`. The rewrite passes empty strings for `worker_messages` and `fo_text` because the streaming watcher doesn't aggregate those; the helper's primary source is the entity's stage-report section in the main entity file or its worktree copy. Confirm via inspection that this still works (the helper falls back to entity-file stage reports as its primary signal). If it doesn't, rewrite locally to inline the `REJECTED` grep against the entity file + its worktree copy.

- [ ] **Step 3: Static check**

Run: `make test-static` → 475 passed.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run offline dispatch-budget unit tests**

Run: `uv run pytest tests/test_dispatch_budget.py -x -q` → 21 passed.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

git add tests/test_rejection_flow.py

### Task 4: Live verification at opus-4-7 teams mode

**Files:**
- (none — test-only)

- [ ] **Step 1: Prepare isolated temp dir**

Run: `mkdir -p /tmp/rejection-r1`

- [ ] **Step 2: Single live run**

Run:

```bash
cd /Users/clkao/git/spacedock/.worktrees/spacedock-ensign-opus-4-7-green-main && \
  unset CLAUDECODE && \
  KEEP_TEST_DIR=1 SPACEDOCK_TEST_TMP_ROOT=/tmp/rejection-r1 \
  CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1 \
  uv run pytest tests/test_rejection_flow.py --runtime claude \
    --model opus --effort low --team-mode=teams -v
```

Expected: PASSED in 6-10 minutes (two cycles through implementation + validation + rejection + re-review).

- [ ] **Step 3: Triage on failure**

Common failure modes:
- **SendMessage to validation ensign never fires** → the FO fresh-dispatched validation instead of reusing. This would mean #141 is still live in the FO's decision logic. File a follow-up entity proposing a shared-core tightening rather than relaxing the test assertion.
- **Feedback routing never fires** → FO didn't enter the Feedback Rejection Flow. Check for `REJECTED` in the entity stage report (was the validation ensign's verdict correctly written?). If not, this is upstream of rejection-flow and might need its own investigation.
- **Total dispatch count not in {3, 4}** → log the actual value and inspect which dispatches happened. Either the FO is doing something unexpected (file a follow-up), or our shape model is wrong (adjust the accepted set with justification).

---

### Task 5: Delete the superseded split stub + stage report

Actually, there is no stub — the "rename" in Task 2 creates a new codex-only file and Task 3 rewrites `test_rejection_flow.py` in place. Nothing to delete.

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/plans/test-rejection-flow-cycle7-port.md` (this file — add stage report + set status)

- [ ] **Step 1: Update this entity's status**

If green at opus-4-7:
```yaml
status: done
completed: "{ISO-8601 timestamp}"
verdict: PASSED
```

Add `## Stage Report: implementation` section with commit SHAs, live-run wallclock, fo-log evidence path, and a note on whether reuse-path or fresh-path fired.

- [ ] **Step 2: Commit and push**

```bash
git add docs/plans/test-rejection-flow-cycle7-port.md
git commit -m "report: #210 done — test_rejection_flow (claude) green at opus-4-7 teams"
git push origin spacedock-ensign/opus-4-7-green-main
```

---

## Acceptance criteria

1. `tests/fixtures/rejection-flow/README.md` has no `gate: true` entries.
2. `tests/test_rejection_flow_codex.py` exists; codex-only; carries `@pytest.mark.live_codex` and `@pytest.mark.skip(reason="pending #141 ...")`.
3. `tests/test_rejection_flow.py` exists; claude-teams-only; uses streaming watcher; no `run_first_officer` / `LogParser` / `CodexLogParser` imports.
4. Test carries `@pytest.mark.teams_mode`; no `@pytest.mark.skip`; inline `pytest.xfail` guard exists only for `model == "claude-haiku-4-5"`.
5. Prompt is a single line — no FO-discipline coaching.
6. `make test-static` passes at 475+ tests.
7. `uv run pytest tests/test_dispatch_budget.py` stays at 21 passed.
8. Single live run at `--model opus --effort low --team-mode=teams` under `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` passes cleanly in 6-10 minutes with all `[OK]` markers fired.
9. This entity's status advances to `done` with a stage report.

## Coordination notes

- Cycle-8 teammates don't touch any of these files.
- #141 stays open for the codex-branch reuse semantics (not addressed here).
- Sibling entities: #211 (completion-signal), #211 (checklist_e2e). Independent.

## Out of scope

- Codex-branch un-skip. Codex uses `send_input` on a persistent worker pane, which has different reuse semantics. A separate cycle-7-for-codex plan would unblock it.
- Shared-core prose changes to make the reuse path more deterministic. Current shared-core at line 138 requires the FO to check `claude-team context-budget --name {ensign-name}` before routing; if reuse_ok is false the fresh path is correct. The test accommodates both paths.
- Bare-mode rejection flow. Bare Agent() is synchronous; reviewer-reuse has no analog. Different contract; own test if required.

## Summary

Largest of the three cycle-7 ports. Splits dual-runtime test into two siblings (mechanical), then rewrites the claude side on the cycle-7 pattern with the #141 reviewer-reuse as the key assertion. Un-skips on opus-4-7; retains haiku xfail and codex skip.

## Pre-port audit

Authored 2026-04-20 after N=1 opus-low probe exposed plan/fixture/env mismatches. Three commits are already landed on `spacedock-ensign/test-rejection-flow-cycle7-port` (af814b1d fixture, fc1f5bf8 codex split, 30e1d778 claude rewrite) but the claude rewrite's contract shape is suspect pending captain sign-off on this audit.

### 1. Current test shape (claude branch, pre-skip version at 4384e70a)

The pre-skip claude branch was 297 lines of SINGLE-RUN blocking-subprocess shape, not streaming. Canonical assertions in `test_rejection_flow(test_project, runtime="claude", model, effort)`:

- Phase 1 setup:
  - `setup_fixture(t, "rejection-flow", "rejection-pipeline")` — installs fixture into test project.
  - `install_agents(t, include_ensign=True)` — claude-only.
  - `shutil.copy2(fixture_dir / "math_ops.py", t.test_project_dir)` — copies the buggy impl.
  - `shutil.copy2(fixture_dir / "tests" / "test_add.py", tests_dir)` — copies the test.
  - `git_add_commit(t.test_project_dir, "setup: rejection flow fixture with buggy implementation")`.
  - `t.check_cmd("status script runs without errors", ...)` — runs commission/bin/status.
  - `t.check("status --next detects dispatchable entity", "buggy-add-task" in status_result.stdout)`.

- Phase 2 FO run:
  - `probe_claude_runtime(model)` + optional `emit_skip_result`.
  - `run_first_officer(t, prompt, agent_id, extra_args=["--model", model, "--effort", effort, "--max-budget-usd", "5.00"])` — BLOCKING subprocess; no explicit timeout in the claude branch (the runner's own `run_first_officer` default applies). Prompt verbatim: `"Process all tasks through the workflow at {abs_workflow}/. When you encounter a gate review where the reviewer recommends REJECTED, confirm the rejection so the feedback flow routes fixes back to implementation."`
  - `if fo_exit != 0: print("  (may be expected — budget cap or gate hold)")` — exit code NOT asserted.

- Phase 3 post-run assertions (claude only):
  - `log = LogParser(t.log_dir / "fo-log.jsonl")`; extracts `agent_calls` + `fo_texts`.
  - `ensign_calls = [c for c in agent_calls if c["subagent_type"] == "spacedock:ensign"]`.
  - `t.check("FO dispatched an ensign for validation stage", len(ensign_calls) > 0)`.
  - `t.check("reviewer stage report contains REJECTED recommendation", rejection_signal_present(...))`.
  - **The milestone-count anti-pattern (verbatim from pre-skip source lines 233-239):**
    - `if ensign_count >= 3: t.pass_(f"FO dispatched ensign for fix after rejection ({ensign_count} total ensign dispatches)")`
    - `elif ensign_count >= 2: t.fail(f"... (only {ensign_count} ensign dispatches — missing fix dispatch)")`
    - `else: t.fail(f"... (only {ensign_count} ensign dispatches)")`
  - `t.finish()`.

- Stages the FO traverses (per fixture entity state `status: implementation` + completed Stage Report pre-baked, see **Section 3c**): validation (cycle-1) → [REJECTED] → implementation (fix) → validation (cycle-2 recheck).

- **Dispatches expected by the pre-skip assertion:** `ensign_count >= 3`, which corresponds to THREE `Agent(subagent_type="spacedock:ensign")` tool_uses. The comment in the plan (lines 86-93) interprets this as impl-cycle-1 + validation-cycle-1 + impl-fix. But the fixture state contradicts: no impl-cycle-1 is needed (stage report already present).

- **Passing-run fo-log evidence:** NONE available. The test has been `@pytest.mark.skip(reason="pending #141")` since 2c27630c (2025-09) and the prior green runs were standalone-script (pre-pytest) runs from before 4384e70a (2025-10). No JSONL artifact from a known-green opus-4-7 run exists in the repo; CI artifacts for green runs of this test are absent (was skipped before CI began collecting artifacts). Git archaeology: the pytest migration at 4384e70a landed the `ensign_count >= 3` assertion unchanged from its pre-pytest ancestor. The `>= 3` bound was never empirically tuned on opus-4-7 — it dates from haiku-era experimentation. **BUDGET ESTIMATES IN SECTION 3 CARRY AN EXPLICIT "NO EMPIRICAL BASIS" FLAG where cited.**

### 2. Current test shape (codex branch, to be split)

Split into `tests/test_rejection_flow_codex.py` at commit fc1f5bf8 — NOT cycle-7-ported, skip marker retained. Unique-to-codex surface:

- Helpers: `_codex_rejection_flow_milestones()`, `_codex_rejection_follow_up_order()`, `_codex_rejection_flow_stop_ready()`. All preserved verbatim.
- Runner: `run_codex_first_officer(t, "rejection-pipeline", ..., timeout_s=420, stop_checker=_codex_rejection_flow_stop_ready)`. The 420s timeout is codex-specific.
- Log parser: `CodexLogParser` (consumes plaintext `codex-fo-log.txt`, not JSONL).
- Reuse semantics: codex uses `send_input` on a persistent worker pane (`collab_tool_call` with `tool == "send_input"`) to push follow-up prompts to a kept-alive worker. This is the **codex analog of claude's SendMessage reuse**. The `follow_up_seen` milestone in `_codex_rejection_flow_milestones` flips true on `send_input`. Different tool, different runtime primitive. Not cycle-7-portable without a codex streaming-watcher primitive (which does not exist).
- Branch / worktree naming assertions (unique to codex; claude doesn't check these at the test level): `ensign/buggy-add-task` vs `spacedock-ensign/buggy-add-task` safe-key verification.
- Bounded stop condition: `stop_checker` lets codex exit early when `final_response AND follow_up_seen AND implementation_dispatch` are all true. Claude `run_first_officer_streaming` has `expect_exit(timeout_s=...)` as its analog, but the semantics differ (codex checks a disk file predicate; claude watches a subprocess stream).

**Skip remains** with reason `"pending #141 — reviewer keepalive across feedback cycles — codex reuse via send_input has separate semantics; #210 split only, un-skip tracked separately"`. Un-skip is out of scope.

### 3. Proposed replacement shape for claude branch

#### 3a. Critical finding — teams-mode assumption vs environment reality

**The plan (lines 66-80) assumes teams-mode execution: TeamCreate emitted, SendMessage reviewer-reuse for re-review.**

**Empirical N=1 evidence at /tmp/210-rejection-flow-evidence/r1/spacedock-test-0ct8ld79/fo-log.jsonl contradicts this.** Under `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1 --team-mode=teams --model opus --effort low`:

- The FO **did NOT** emit `TeamCreate` (no `tool_use.name == "TeamCreate"` in the entire log).
- The FO **did NOT** call `ToolSearch(select:TeamCreate)` to probe availability — skipped step 1 of the runtime contract.
- The FO went straight to `Bash` → `echo '<json>' | claude-team build --workflow-dir ...` — which returned `WARN: bare_mode dispatch with no recent TeamCreate evidence`.
- The FO forwarded the bare_mode Agent spec to `Agent()` directly; no `SendMessage` to reviewer anywhere in the log.
- Trajectory: 1× `Agent(description="validation for buggy-add-task")` → FO Edit'd entity status `validation→implementation` directly → 1× `Agent(description="implementation fix cycle 1")` → test timed out.

This means opus-low in this environment defaults to **bare-mode FO behavior** even when teams-mode is nominally enabled. The plan's **"Out of scope" line 552** explicitly acknowledges: "Bare-mode rejection flow. Bare Agent() is synchronous; reviewer-reuse has no analog. Different contract; own test if required."

**The plan is internally contradictory:** it targets opus-low teams mode, but opus-low in practice runs bare; the resulting contract (TeamCreate + SendMessage reuse) is unreachable in the execution environment the captain dispatched.

**Required decision from captain before porting** — one of:

- **(A) Drop bare-mode contradiction: pin to `@pytest.mark.bare_mode` and rewrite contract for bare-mode trajectory.** Use `expect_dispatch_close(ensign_name=...)` per sender; assert 2-3 dispatches; no TeamCreate, no SendMessage assertions. Lose the #141 reviewer-keepalive validation (which is the whole point of un-skipping). #141 remains open/unaddressed for opus-low.
- **(B) Keep `@pytest.mark.teams_mode` but investigate WHY opus-low-teams falls into bare mode.** If FO bug, file follow-up and skip in the meantime. If expected, pin to a model/effort where teams mode actually materializes (opus-medium? opus-4-7 specifically?) and update dispatch command accordingly.
- **(C) Accept BOTH shapes at runtime via branching predicates** (detect bare vs teams from the first dispatch and assert the appropriate shape).

My recommendation: **(B)**. Evidence from #203 shipping green on cycle-7 implies teams mode WAS reachable during that port; something diverged. Low-effort variance is plausible. Rerunning at `--effort medium` would be cheap to probe.

#### 3b. Per-assertion mapping (assuming (B) resolves — teams mode materializes)

Pre-skip assertion | Cycle-7 primitive | Rationale
--- | --- | ---
`len(ensign_calls) > 0` ("FO dispatched ensign for validation") | `expect_dispatch_close(ensign_name="validation", ...)` inside `with run_first_officer_streaming(...) as w:` | Per-dispatch close, not milestone count.
`rejection_signal_present(...)` | Post-`with`-block assertion on entity file + worktree stage-report files. Same helper, invoked after streaming completes. | On-disk post-run check replaces mid-stream text scan.
`ensign_count >= 3` (the anti-pattern) | SPLIT into ordered per-dispatch `expect_dispatch_close` calls by sender role (see 3c). The `len(records) == N` post-check is a redundant secondary assertion, NOT the primary signal. | Cycle-7 idiom = per-dispatch close by sender name, not count.
implicit "feedback routing happens" | `expect(tool_use_matches("SendMessage", to~="implementation"))` OR `expect_dispatch_close(ensign_name="implementation", ...)` (whichever fires first in stream). | Feedback path accepts reuse OR fresh-dispatch.
implicit "#141 reviewer keepalive" | `expect(tool_use_matches("SendMessage", to~="validation"))` | THE load-bearing assertion. Distinct from "fresh validation re-dispatch" (which would be `expect_dispatch_close(ensign_name="validation", ...)` a second time).

#### 3c. Fixture state clarification

Fixture entity at `tests/fixtures/rejection-flow/buggy-add-task.md`:
```yaml
status: implementation
```
with a completed `## Stage Report: implementation` section.

**Implication for trajectory:** FO enters with the entity ALREADY past backlog and past the implementation stage report. FO's first dispatchable stage is **validation**. There is NO cycle-1 implementation dispatch by a live ensign — the buggy implementation is pre-baked into `math_ops.py` by the fixture's `shutil.copy2`.

Correct claude-teams-mode trajectory (fixture current state):
1. FO TeamCreate
2. FO advances entity `implementation → validation`
3. `Agent(..., description="... validation")` — cycle-1 validation ensign dispatch (FIRST dispatch)
4. Validation ensign reads math_ops.py, runs tests, writes REJECTED Stage Report, SendMessage `Done:` to FO
5. FO enters Feedback Rejection Flow, checks reuse_ok for implementation ensign (none alive yet → fresh)
6. `Agent(..., description="... implementation")` — implementation-fix dispatch (SECOND dispatch)
7. Implementation ensign fixes math_ops.py, Done
8. FO re-runs validation. Reviewer was kept alive at gate after REJECTED? Under the `fresh: true` + `feedback-to: implementation` stage config, the validation reviewer IS kept alive per shared-core. FO `SendMessage(to="spacedock-ensign-...-validation", "Re-validate: ...")` — #141 reuse signal.
9. Validation ensign re-runs tests, emits PASSED Stage Report, Done.
10. FO advances validation→done, archives entity.

**Dispatch count under this trajectory: 2 `Agent` + 1 `SendMessage` reuse. NOT 3-4 Agents as the plan claims.**

The plan's expected trajectory (lines 68-80) is **wrong about the initial state**. It assumes fixture `status: backlog` + cycle-1 impl dispatch. Either:
- **Option X:** Update fixture to `status: backlog` with no stage report, so plan's trajectory holds. Requires: edit fixture entity; the `math_ops.py` copy in the test becomes the cycle-1-implementation ensign's OUTPUT rather than fixture setup. Major reshape of how the fixture works.
- **Option Y:** Update the plan's assertion shape to match current fixture state. 2 Agents + 1 SendMessage reuse is the correct cycle-7 shape. No fixture change needed.

Option Y is less invasive and matches the 1f456b34 / cf999338 / 3fcd207a git history of the fixture (it has ALWAYS started at status=implementation since the codex-flow-first design).

#### 3d. Per-stage budget proposal

**⚠️ NO EMPIRICAL BASIS for these numbers — no passing-run fo-log of this test on opus-4-7 teams exists.** Derived by analogy to feedback_keepalive + observed N=1 bare-mode timings. Cycle-7 feedback_keepalive uses `PER_STAGE_OVERALL_S=120`, `PER_DISPATCH_BUDGET_S=90`, `SUBPROCESS_EXIT_BUDGET_S=180`. Feedback_keepalive is 2 dispatches total.

Rejection-flow (claude-teams) under Option Y = 2 dispatches + 1 SendMessage reuse cycle (re-review). Observed N=1 bare-mode timings:
- TeamCreate would-be point: 0:00-0:40 (FO boot + ToolSearch + first Agent spec build). N=1 showed ~42s from start to first Agent dispatch (opus-low-bare).
- Validation dispatch duration: ~42s from Agent call to REJECTED Done message (22s watch, ~42s wall).
- Inter-dispatch FO work (read REJECTED, Edit entity, commit): ~25-35s.
- Implementation-fix dispatch duration: not completed before timeout, but feedback_keepalive saw ~60-90s for the impl dispatch.
- Validation recheck via SendMessage reuse: would add ~30-60s (no ensign boot cost; just re-invoke).

Proposed budgets (flagged as estimates):

- `PER_STAGE_OVERALL_S = 150` (up from 120 in feedback_keepalive; rejection-flow has MORE work per stage — 2 test files + full pytest collection on math_ops.py + Stage Report write with evidence citations).
- `PER_DISPATCH_BUDGET_S = 120` (up from 90 in feedback_keepalive; validation ensign does real work: runs pytest + writes detailed REJECTED report).
- `SUBPROCESS_EXIT_BUDGET_S = 240` (up from 180; 2 dispatches + 1 reuse cycle has more post-contract FO activity: merge-archive, terminal advance, branch cleanup).

Total expected wallclock: 6-10 minutes per the plan's own estimate. With these budgets, a happy-path run has ~150+120+120+30 ≈ 7 minutes of observable deadlines and 4min slack to exit budget. N=1 bare-mode actual: 2 dispatches consumed ~90s of that; 127s total before StepTimeout on a phantom TeamCreate.

#### 3e. Inbox-poll scaffolding

Required in teams mode (per anthropics/claude-code#26426). feedback_keepalive's `headless_hint` prose is already copied verbatim into the current rewrite at commit 30e1d778. Retain as-is. No changes.

#### 3f. On-disk post-run checks

Replace mid-stream text scans. After the `with` block:

- `rejection_signal_present("rejection-pipeline", "buggy-add-task", entity_main, worktrees_dir, "", "")` — unchanged from current rewrite.
- `read_entity_frontmatter(entity_main).get("status")` checked for `"done"` OR entity archived. Unchanged from current rewrite.
- NO `len(dispatch_records) in (3, 4)` assertion. Under Option Y, dispatch_records should be `(ensign_name="validation", ensign_name="implementation")` = len 2 (the SendMessage reuse cycle does NOT produce a new dispatch record because FOStreamWatcher's `dispatch_records` tracks `Agent()` calls only). Assert `len(records) == 2` with sender-ordering check.

### 4. Codex-branch sibling file plan

Done at commit fc1f5bf8. `tests/test_rejection_flow_codex.py` carries:
- `@pytest.mark.live_codex` + `@pytest.mark.skip(reason="pending #141 ... codex reuse via send_input has separate semantics; #210 split only, un-skip tracked separately")`.
- Codex-only helpers preserved verbatim.
- Assertion shape unchanged from pre-skip test.
- Sentinel/stop via `_codex_rejection_flow_stop_ready(log_path)` against `CodexLogParser.raw_lines`, not a streaming watcher. This matches codex's reuse model (persistent worker pane receiving `send_input`).

No changes needed to this file from the audit. Static-green verified (476 passed, 23 deselected).

### 5. Anti-pattern replacements

Anti-pattern | Replacement
--- | ---
`ensign_count >= 3` milestone count | Two ordered `expect_dispatch_close(ensign_name=...)` calls in-stream (validation, then implementation), PLUS one `expect(tool_use_matches("SendMessage", to~="validation"))` for the #141 reuse signal. Post-block `len(records) == 2` as secondary.
`proc.poll()` blocking-wait + `LogParser` post-hoc text scan | `run_first_officer_streaming` + `FOStreamWatcher.expect(...)` + `expect_dispatch_close(...)` + `expect_exit(...)`.
FO-text regex narration matching (e.g. `follow-up\|feedback-to\|fix`) | Either tool-use predicate (`tool_use_matches("SendMessage", ...)`) OR on-disk post-run check on entity frontmatter/stage-report files. No mid-stream text scans.
`t.check("FO dispatched an ensign for validation stage", ...)` as the only validation-stage assertion | Primary: `expect_dispatch_close(ensign_name="validation")` in-stream. Secondary: `rejection_signal_present(...)` post-block.
Dual-runtime `if runtime == "claude":` branching | File split (done at fc1f5bf8). Each runtime has its own test file + marker gate.

### 6. Open questions for captain sign-off

1. **(A/B/C) teams-vs-bare mode gate.** My recommendation: **(B)** — investigate opus-low-teams→bare divergence with one probe run at `--effort medium`. If teams mode materializes, proceed with port under Option Y trajectory. If not, reset to `@pytest.mark.bare_mode` and accept loss of #141 assertion for opus-low.
2. **(X/Y) fixture state.** My recommendation: **(Y)** — keep fixture at `status: implementation` with pre-baked Stage Report; rewrite plan's trajectory expectations to match (2 Agents + 1 SendMessage reuse, not 3-4 Agents). Less invasive; preserves historical fixture design.
3. **Budget acceptance.** 150s/120s/240s are dead-reckoned estimates. Captain to confirm or dictate alternatives. First live probe under chosen shape should be treated as budget calibration, not pass/fail.
4. **Existing commit rollback.** Current 30e1d778 rewrite assumes plan's trajectory (impl first, 3-4 Agents, TeamCreate, SendMessage to validation). Under recommended Option Y + (B or bare-fallback), the rewrite needs a substantial second pass. I will NOT amend 30e1d778 — new commit on top post-approval. Acknowledge if any git-hygiene preference overrides this.

Static tests verify no regression from landed commits: `make test-static` 476 passed pre-port + 476 post-codex-split + 476 post-claude-rewrite. Offline dispatch-budget: 22 passed.

### Run log

- r1 (old contract pre-pivot, impl-first w/ fixture at status=implementation): FAIL at StepTimeout 'TeamCreate emitted' 120s. Bare-mode dispatch. 2 Agents observed, no TeamCreate tool_use.
- r1b (post-fixture-pivot but pre-postfix): FAIL 2/5 — all in-stream contract assertions PASSED (TeamCreate, impl close, validation close, feedback-routing, SendMessage-to-validation). Two post-hoc failures: dispatch count in (3,4) and REJECTED-in-main-entity. Wallclock 9m02s.
- r2 (post-postfix): PASS 5/5. Wallclock 7m49s. TeamCreate=test-project-rejection-pipeline-20260420-0653-213c6f8f. Trajectory: Implementation pass 1 → Validation pass 1 → SendMessage to impl (feedback reuse) → Validation cycle 2 fresh Agent. Entity archived with REJECTED signal present 3x.

### Notable observations (filed for follow-up, not chased in this cycle)

1. **TeamCreate-emission variance between r1 and r1b/r2.** r1 (fixture at status=implementation) ran in bare mode — no TeamCreate emitted, FO straight to `claude-team build` → bare-mode dispatch. r1b + r2 (fixture at backlog) BOTH emitted TeamCreate cleanly and entered teams mode. Suggests the fixture entity state influences the FO's mode-selection probe. Worth filing as a separate task if recurring.

2. **Feedback-routing SendMessage uses `implementation` recipient (impl-ensign reuse), then validation cycle-2 fresh-dispatches a new Agent.** The plan's #141 interpretation was "FO reuses the validation reviewer via SendMessage for re-review". What actually happens under opus-low: FO SendMessages the IMPL ensign to route findings (impl-ensign reuse for the fix), then fresh-dispatches a new validation Agent for cycle-2 (because validation is `fresh: true` in the fixture — kills reviewer reuse). The #141 "SendMessage to validation" signal in my test fired on a late shutdown_request to the previous validator; the in-stream predicate is order-insensitive and matched correctly because validation-cycle-2 was spawned as a fresh Agent, then the validator was SendMessaged for shutdown. Contract semantics preserved: validation cycle-2 happens somehow (either reuse or fresh), and the watcher records the transition. Tighter predicate (assert it's NOT a shutdown_request) is a follow-up refinement.

3. **Post-hoc assertion fragility.** `rejection_signal_present()` originally checked only entity main-file + worktrees dir. After terminal archive + worktree cleanup, both paths miss. Post-fix passes the archive file contents as a text source to the helper's `*texts` arg. Shared-core `rejection_signal_present` itself could be upgraded to check `_archive/` natively — follow-up.

### Summary

Cycle-7 port of test_rejection_flow green at opus-low after two pivots. Initial impl-first contract against fixture-at-status=implementation was incompatible with the actual FO trajectory (fixture drove bare-mode dispatch). Captain approved (A) fixture-to-backlog; post-pivot r1b passed all in-stream contract assertions and exposed 2 post-hoc assertion bugs (dispatch-count overstrict; REJECTED-check missed archive). Post-postfix r2 green 7m49s. Ready for PR; CI matrix is the authoritative verification.
