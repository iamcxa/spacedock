## Problem

Stage Reports often contain checklist items marked DONE with minimal evidence ("all checks pass" without showing what was checked). Entity 051 (75%) and 052 (70%) shipped with thin evidence that didn't surface the actual gaps until post-ship review.

## Scope

Add "evidence minimum" rules to each stage skill's Rules section:
- Execute: per-task commit SHA, files changed count, test evidence per AC
- Quality: actual command output (first/last N lines), test count, fail details
- Review: classified findings table with file:line citations
- UAT: per-item evidence table with inline artifacts

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Given a completed execute stage, when Stage Report is written, then it includes per-task commit SHA, files changed count, and at minimum 1 line of test evidence per AC (how to verify: read execute Stage Report, confirm evidence fields present)
- [ ] Given all 4 stage skills, when their Rules sections are read, then each has a documented "evidence minimum" requirement (how to verify: grep "evidence minimum" in execute/quality/review/uat SKILL.md Rules)
